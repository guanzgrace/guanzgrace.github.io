I am a fifth year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, working with [Margaret Brandeau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/margaret-brandeau) and [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/). My research focuses on using data science and machine learning to solve operations and market design problems while informing policy decisions. I'm grateful to be supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), the [Stanford Data Science Scholarship](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program) (2023-2025), and the [Stanford Technology & Racial Equity Graduate Fellowship](https://ccsre.stanford.edu/programs/technology-racial-equity-graduate-fellowship) (2022-2023). 

In 2020, I graduated from Princeton with a BS in Computer Science with minors in [Global Health & Health Policy](https://globalhealth.princeton.edu/) and [Statistics & Machine Learning](https://csml.princeton.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with [Mark Braverman](https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/) and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/barbara-engelhardt). I formerly interned at [Lyft](https://lyft.com/), [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) Health, [Google](https://google.com/), and [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com).

In my free time, you can find me weightlifting, swimming, and hiking.

You can reach me at gzguan at stanford dot edu.
