# About

Hi! I received my PhD from Stanford in Autumn 2025, where I worked with [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/) and [Al Roth](https://marketdesigner.blogspot.com/2025/10/grace-guan-defends-her-dissertation-at.html). I was grateful to be supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [Stanford Data Science Scholarship](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program). My PhD research was on market design (matching optimization) using ML, simulation, and experimentation as tools to improve organ allocation. During my PhD, I interned at [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) on matching optimization.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated from Princeton with a BSE in Computer Science with a minor in [Statistics & Machine Learning](https://csml.princeton.edu/). During undergrad, I interned at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/), [Google](https://google.com/), and [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com).

## Organ Allocation Research

My PhD research was on **market design (matching)**: Improving the complex kidney allocation system with **ML, optimization, simulation, and experimentation** and had real-world policy impact. Highlights include:

- Developed heuristics [1] and end-to-end ML models [2, 3] to predict nonuse risk of deceased donor kidneys, developing scalable pipelines and evaluation workflows (Python)
- Reached out directly to C-suite leaders at over 15 organ procurement organizations (~25% of the nation's total) and recruited them to a **pilot switchback experiment** [4], applying causal inference methods to measure the causal effect of integrating ML predictions into clinical workflows (Python)
- Developed a scalable, optimized kidney allocation **simulator** that modeled real-world acceptance behavior and competing risks, and leveraged market design principles to design, optimize, and test new allocation policies with the simulator [5] (Python, Pytorch, C, C++)

- In April 2025, I gave a talk about this work (["How Data-driven Insights Can Inform National Organ Allocation Policy"](https://globalhealth.princeton.edu/events/2025/how-data-driven-insights-can-inform-national-organ-allocation-policy)) at Princeton Global Health Policy


## Selected health policy research

I have also worked on various projects in hospital operations and health policy, leading to 8 other publications (6 first-author) in medical journals and CS conferences (see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xcJ3x40AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>).
