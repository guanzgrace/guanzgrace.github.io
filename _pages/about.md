I am a final year PhD student at Stanford MS&E, co-advised by [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/) and [Margaret Brandeau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/margaret-brandeau). My research is broadly in applied data science (ML and experimentation) and market design with the goal of working with stakeholders to inform policy decisions. I have become increasingly interested in other applications of AI in marketplaces, AI safety, and the impacts that AI will have on society.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated from Princeton with a BS in Computer Science with minors in [Global Health Policy](https://globalhealth.princeton.edu/) and [Statistics & Machine Learning](https://csml.princeton.edu/). During undergrad, I interned at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/), [Google](https://google.com/), and [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com).

I'm grateful to be supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [Stanford Data Science Scholarship](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program).

In my free time, you can find me weightlifting, swimming, and hiking. I also enjoy going to museums and learning about art history. I was a tour guide and student outreach chair for the Princeton University Art Museum and have written many [blog posts](https://puamsab.princeton.edu/?s=grace+guan) about art.

You can reach me at gzguan at stanford dot edu.
