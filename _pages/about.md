I am a final year PhD student at Stanford MS&E, co-advised by [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/) and [Margaret Brandeau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/margaret-brandeau). My research is broadly in applied data science (ML and experimentation) and market design with the goal of working with stakeholders to inform policy decisions. I've also worked on research in hospital operations and health policy. I have become increasingly interested in other applications of AI and the impacts that it will have on society.

I interned at [Lyft](https://lyft.com/) in summer 2024, where I developed a matching algorithm intervention and designed an A/B test, resulting in a successfully shipped feature. Prior to my PhD, I graduated from Princeton with a BS in Computer Science with minors in [Global Health Policy](https://globalhealth.princeton.edu/) and [Statistics & Machine Learning](https://csml.princeton.edu/) in 2020. During undergrad, I interned at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/), [Google](https://google.com/), and [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com).

I'm grateful to be supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), the [Stanford Data Science Scholarship](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program) (2023-2025), and the [Stanford Technology & Racial Equity Graduate Fellowship](https://ccsre.stanford.edu/programs/technology-racial-equity-graduate-fellowship) (2022-2023).

In my free time, you can find me weightlifting, swimming, and hiking.
