I am interested in AI safety and societal impacts.


## Organ Allocation

My PhD research was on **matching** and **market design** using **data science** tools (**machine learning**, **experimentation**). I worked with Itai Ashlagi and Nobel laureate Al Roth on improving the complex deceased donor kidney allocation system and had real-world policy impact. 

Specifically, I developed heuristics [1] and a **machine learning tool** [2, 3] to predict when a deceased donor kidney would be at risk of nonuse. I designed a **switchback experiment** [4] with organ procurement organizations to assess the causal effect of the machine learning tool on medical decision making. I also designed alternative allocation policies with principles from **mechanism design** to improve efficiency and equity [5]. I built a kidney allocation policy **simulator** in C/C++/Python to evaluate these alternative policies.
