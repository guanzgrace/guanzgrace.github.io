During my PhD, I worked with Itai Ashlagi and Nobel laureate Al Roth on deceased donor organ allocation (most of this work is forthcoming). I also worked on various projects in hospital operations and health policy. For a full list of my publications, please visit my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xcJ3x40AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.
